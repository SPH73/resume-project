 Introduction
 
 This site is mini project for an online resume for a ficticious web developer.
 
 Across all the pages the header, navigation and footer are identical and all the
 links and transistions are the same as these elements were coded and then 
 duplicated prior to adding the unique content for each page.
 
 Bootstrap was used for the grid and classes and the rule of thirds was applied 
 in order to create a balanced feel.
 
 The colour schemes are nicely contrasted and balanced and subtle transistions
 were selected from cdnjs.con so as to avoid visual chaos.
 
 from cdn.js a link to hover.css was used to create a very pleasant sweeping 
 effect on the menu items.
